# Cheat Sheet Series
üå± Cheat Sheet Series is new and needs your support to flourish. Support us by by joining **[stargazers](https://github.com/MostafaAryan/Cheat-Sheet-Series/stargazers)** ‚≠êÔ∏è for this repository. 

ü§® **Why the Cheat Sheet Series?** You may have noticed that when you type your problem in the search bar, there are many different solutions out there. But you have to spend time to find the best article/post that addresses all aspects of the problem. Sometimes you have to combine multiple solutions to make things work. In the **Cheat Sheet Series**, we have done the hard work for you. We have collected, analyzed and filtered different articles/posts related to a solution and finally offered a collection of best practices to address the problem in a single comprehensive article. Each Cheat Sheet Series article explains all possible solutions and the pros and cons of each and finally provides link(s) to the implementation guide of that solution.
